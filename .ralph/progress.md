## [2026-04-27 18:25:15 +08:00] - US-007: Generate from a single selected reference image
Thread:
Run: 20260427-180400-335 (iteration 1)

- Guardrails reviewed: yes
- No-commit run: false
- Commit: 88f6bc6 Implement reference image generation
- Post-commit status: `clean`
- Verification:
  - Command: `pnpm typecheck` -> PASS
  - Command: `pnpm build` -> PASS
  - Command: Chrome DevTools browser verification at `http://127.0.0.1:5174/` -> PASS (zero/multiple selections showed disabled Chinese hints; a single uploaded canvas image enabled reference mode; edit submit reached missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` response)
- Files changed:
  - .agents/tasks/prd-gpt-image-canvas.json
  - .ralph/activity.log
  - .ralph/progress.md
  - apps/api/src/image-generation.ts
  - apps/api/src/image-provider.ts
  - apps/api/src/index.ts
  - apps/web/src/App.tsx
- What was implemented
  - Added persisted `/api/images/edit` generation using the existing batch concurrency, asset save, SQLite generation record, and output persistence flow.
  - Added selected tldraw image detection in the AI panel with Chinese ready/disabled hints for zero, multiple, non-image, and unreadable selections.
  - Supported readable user-added canvas images by fetching the selected image asset/blob into a data URL before edit submission, with a 20MB reference image limit.
  - Recorded `referenceAssetId` for generated local assets by preserving local asset metadata and parsing `/api/assets/:id` URLs.
  - Reused the text-to-image grid insertion flow for edit outputs and switched the submit button into reference generation mode when exactly one image is selected.
  - Security/performance/regression review: no secrets or authorization headers are logged; invalid local reference IDs are rejected before persistence; selected image reads are bounded to 20MB; existing text-to-image, autosave, and validation behavior still pass typecheck/build and browser smoke.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - tldraw selection changes are most reliable when the app listens to both store changes and the editor `change` event; store-only listeners missed the media insertion selection in browser verification.
  - Browser verification can upload a local image through the tldraw media button and confirm the AI panel reference state without live OpenAI credentials.
  - Vite may auto-select port `5174` when another service already owns `5173`; check the dev log before navigating.

## [2026-04-27 17:17:10 +08:00] - US-004: Autosave and restore the tldraw project
Thread:

- Commit: af5ce51 Implement tldraw project autosave
- Post-commit status: `clean`
- Verification:
  - Command: `pnpm typecheck` -> PASS
  - Command: `pnpm dev` -> PASS (API on 127.0.0.1:8787; Vite used 127.0.0.1:5174 because 5173 was busy)
  - Command: `python Playwright browser autosave/refresh restore verification against http://127.0.0.1:5174` -> PASS
  - Command: `python Playwright browser failed-save verification with intercepted PUT /api/project` -> PASS
  - Command: `pnpm build` -> PASS
- Files changed:
  - .agents/tasks/prd-gpt-image-canvas.json
  - apps/web/src/App.tsx
  - .ralph/activity.log
  - .ralph/progress.md
- What was implemented
  - Loaded `/api/project` before mounting tldraw and restored a persisted tldraw snapshot when present.
  - Added debounced document-scope autosave using `editor.store.listen({ source: "user", scope: "document" })` and `editor.getSnapshot()`.
  - Added compact Chinese save status in the AI panel and a non-blocking Chinese error message for load/save failures.
  - Browser-verified that a rectangle shape saves, survives refresh, and restores from the API snapshot.
  - Browser-verified a forced save failure shows the error while the current canvas shape remains visible.
  - Security/performance/regression review: no secrets or user data logging added; autosave is debounced and document-scoped; existing prompt validation, panel controls, typecheck, build, and browser rendering still pass.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - tldraw's `snapshot` prop is initial-load only, so the app should wait for `/api/project` before rendering `<Tldraw>`.
  - `editor.store.listen` with document scope avoids autosaving camera/session-only changes and pointer movement; debounce still covers drag/create bursts.
  - Chrome DevTools MCP was blocked by a locked profile in this environment; Python Playwright was a reliable fallback for required browser verification.

## [2026-04-27 17:03:24 +08:00] - US-003: Create React tldraw workspace shell

  - apps/web/tailwind.config.ts
  - apps/web/tsconfig.json
  - apps/web/vite.config.ts
  - pnpm-lock.yaml
- What was implemented
  - Added the React/Vite/Tailwind/tldraw web workspace shell and Vite proxy configuration for `/api`.
  - Rendered a full-height tldraw canvas with a fixed right-side Chinese AI control panel.
  - Added visible prompt, style preset, scene size preset, custom width/height, count, generate, and cancel controls.
  - Added collapsible advanced controls for quality and output format.
  - Kept model selection, background controls, and transparent background controls out of the UI.
  - Wired scene preset changes to update the visible width and height fields and disabled generation for empty prompts with a Chinese validation message.
  - Browser-verified the canvas and panel render without overlap, preset dimension syncing works, and advanced controls are usable.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vite needs an alias to `packages/shared/src/index.ts` so web dev can consume shared contracts before the shared package is built.
  - tldraw pulls a large client bundle; the build warning is expected for this shell and should be revisited when route-level code splitting becomes useful.
  - Chrome DevTools MCP was unavailable because its profile was already locked, so Python Playwright was used for the required browser verification.

## [2026-04-27 16:28:21 +08:00] - US-002: Build Hono API with SQLite persistence

  - apps/api/src/runtime.ts
  - apps/api/src/schema.ts
  - pnpm-lock.yaml
  - .ralph/progress.md
- What was implemented
  - Added Hono API runtime with `@hono/node-server`, dotenv-backed `HOST`, `PORT`, and `DATA_DIR`, and automatic creation of the data directory, assets directory, and SQLite database.
  - Added Drizzle SQLite schema and startup DDL for `Project`, `Asset`, `GenerationRecord`, and `GenerationOutput` tables with indexes and foreign keys.
  - Implemented `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/config`, `GET /api/project`, and `PUT /api/project` for the single default project snapshot.
  - Validated project save payloads before database writes so invalid snapshots return a 400 JSON error and preserve the previous stored project state.
  - Smoke-verified that a saved snapshot reloads after restarting the built API against the same SQLite data directory.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API code should avoid importing shared package source directly until the monorepo has project references or built type declarations wired for cross-package typecheck.
  - Relative `DATA_DIR` is resolved from the repo root so `.env` values like `./data` behave consistently when running filtered package scripts.
  - Use a temp `DATA_DIR` for API smoke checks to avoid leaving SQLite files or assets in the repository workspace.

  - tsconfig.base.json
- What was implemented
  - Normalized the repository into a pnpm 9.14.2 workspace with root scripts and package boundaries for `apps/api`, `apps/web`, and `packages/shared`.
  - Preserved Ralph templates under `.agents/ralph` and the executable PRD at `.agents/tasks/prd-gpt-image-canvas.json`.
  - Added `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, README, and AGENTS operational notes that document required runtime variables, quality gates, ignored runtime artifacts, and no-secret handling.
  - Repaired shared TypeScript contracts enough for scaffold typecheck/build, including fixed GPT Image 2 constants, presets, request/response types, and size helpers.
  - Added minimal API and web TypeScript package entrypoints so the workspace builds deterministically before feature stories add Hono/Vite/tldraw.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The initial scaffold had empty `apps/api` and `apps/web` package directories; future stories can now add implementation without first creating workspace metadata.
  - `packages/shared/src/index.ts` contained corrupted strings and syntax errors, so contract files should be checked with `pnpm typecheck` before reuse.
  - `.ralph/` is intentionally ignored by the repo scaffold even though Ralph progress/activity files are updated during runs.

  - pnpm-lock.yaml
  - .ralph/activity.log
  - .ralph/progress.md
- What was implemented
  - Added a GPT Image 2 OpenAI-compatible image provider interface with generate and edit methods.
  - Read `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` only through dotenv/runtime environment and enforced `gpt-image-2` in provider payloads.
  - Added shared scene/custom size validation that returns an OpenAI-compatible `WIDTHxHEIGHT` value.
  - Added `/api/images/generate` and `/api/images/edit` validation paths with Chinese JSON errors for missing key, invalid prompt, invalid size, unsupported provider behavior, and upstream failure.
  - Quieted dotenv loading so secrets and runtime environment details are not echoed during API startup checks.
  - Security/performance/regression review: no API keys or full auth headers are logged; invalid requests return before provider creation; provider calls add no heavy loops or extra upstream requests; config/project behavior still passes typecheck and build.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API cannot import shared package source directly while `rootDir` is `apps/api/src`; consume shared built declarations and build shared before API typecheck/dev.
  - Keep size validation in `packages/shared` and have API routes use the shared `apiValue` so US-006 can persist/provider-call the same resolved dimensions.
  - Invalid size checks should run before credential checks so negative validation tests never contact upstream, even when credentials are configured.

  - apps/api/src/image-provider.ts
  - apps/api/src/index.ts
  - apps/api/tsconfig.json
  - apps/web/src/App.tsx
- What was implemented
  - Added `/api/images/generate` persistence that composes style presets into the effective prompt, fans out count requests with backend concurrency limited to 2, saves successful files under `data/assets`, records generation/output rows in SQLite, and returns per-output success or failure.
  - Added local asset serving through `/api/assets/:id` so generated records can be inserted into tldraw image assets.
  - Wired the AI panel to submit generation requests, abort/cancel in-flight requests, prevent canceled responses from inserting onto the canvas, and place successful outputs in a centered grid in the current viewport.
  - Fixed the API dev tsconfig shared path so `pnpm api:dev` resolves the built shared runtime entry instead of a declaration-only file.
  - Security/performance/regression review: API keys and authorization headers are not logged; asset serving resolves only stored files under `data/assets`; batch generation uses a two-worker limiter; missing credentials still produce the expected runtime error; project load/save and build/typecheck still pass.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `tsx watch` honors the API tsconfig path at runtime; mapping shared to `dist/index.d.ts` breaks API dev even though typecheck can pass. Use the built shared entry path without an extension.
  - tldraw image insertion can use stable `asset:` and `shape:` IDs with `editor.createAssets`, `editor.createShapes`, and `editor.getViewportPageBounds().center` for viewport-centered placement.
  - Browser verification can use a headless Chrome DevTools protocol smoke when live credentials are missing; this validates the real Vite UI path and the missing-key API response without exposing secrets.

- What was implemented
  - Added /api/assets/:id/download with attachment disposition for stored assets.
  - Fixed persisted generation mode so refreshed edit history remains distinguishable.
  - Loaded recent history into the right panel with prompt excerpt, mode, size, status, created time, output count, and locate/rerun/download actions.
  - Matched locate actions to existing tldraw image assets via local asset id and showed a Chinese not-found message after canvas deletion.
  - Rerun reuses prompt, style preset, exact size, quality, format, count, and stored reference asset when present.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - /api/project already returned history; US-008 mainly needed UI wiring plus the download route.
  - Generated canvas assets store the local asset id in tldraw asset meta, which is the reliable bridge from history output to canvas shape.
  - Browser verification can use ignored local data rows when live credentials are unavailable; do not commit data/assets or SQLite files.
